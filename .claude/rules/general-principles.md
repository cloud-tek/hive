During coding the following rules are to be followed at ALL times.

# KISS Principle:
- Write straightforward code that a beginner could follow.
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, simpler steps.

# YAGNI Principle:
- Implement only the features explicitly defined in the current requirements.
- Remove unused code and features.

# SOLID Principles:
- SRP: Each class/module has a single responsibility.
- OCP: Extend functionality without modifying existing code.
- LSP: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
- ISP: Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use.
- DIP: Depend on abstractions, not concretions.
